## Assignment 5: 

For me the hardest part was understanding the role of an "upstream branch" and how that changed the process of pushing, commiting and pulling. I have worked with git but not with forks as much so I thought this practice was very useful. Still I felt a little lost especially trying to remember when to commit and push as well as the difference between them. Despite this, the assignment helped bring back the memories of how to use git especially when I haven't used it in a long time. I  will for sure try a few practice problems on remote branching as this was the most confusing part for me in general. Even when I read the section in the textbook it didn't help me understand remote branching too well. I definitely learn more through hands on projects and visual models than through reading large amounts of text. The only exception to this is clear and straightforward documentation.
