The __GNU General Public License (GNU GPL)__ is used for software packages 
while __GNU Lesser General Public License__ is also  used for a few GNU libraries. 
The GNU Lesser GPL allows libraries to be used in private programs while the GNU GPL only allows libraries to be used in free programs.
The __GNU Affero General Public License__ includes the permission to recieve source code for a program licensed over a network.    

Finally there is the __GNU Free Documentation License__ which is intended to use on any type of documentation when it comes to software or a program.
This includes manuals and documents It even gives all users the right to change the documentation and redistribute it. 

__Copyleft__ is a process where a program that is free software requires all of its versions and contributions by users to also be considered free
software. There are multiple ways to acomplish this, including putting the software in the public domain but because 
third party could still use the code for profit if obtained through public domain, the GNU project created a process to prevent this.
The copyleft process ensures that all subsequent versions follow the freedom to copy,use,and distribute according to the original code. Basically 
instead of "copyright" for secrecy and private ownership, GNU Project creates the opposite with a "copyleft". (This made me chuckle). 


Similarly, the [__All-Permissive License__](https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/html_node/All_002dpermissive-Copying-License.html) 
is a supporting license for the copyleft that also ensures inherited freedom of change and distribution to README and other documentation
files. [Permissive Licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_licence) are lenient licenses that offer little or barely any information
on redistribution. This is why the All-Permissive License is a mere 5 line copyright.    

For the [Apache License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html), it includes a termination of the patent license that occurs
if anyone sues another group or person for patent infringement. This is only possible because the Apache License lets anyone who uses the software
sell their code as long as they do not make contributors responsible for any outcomes. Apache is also only compatible with 
 GNU GPL version 3. Does this mean that patent litigation is different from enforcing their copyleft license? This confusion is likely
 caused by my ignorance of licensing laws and prosecution of infringement. 
 
 The __CC0__ is the Creative Commons License that puts your work into the public domain. As said before, entering work into the public domain 
 doe snot stop proprietary software from being created from the source and being sold or copyrighted. 
 
 The __Mozilla Public License__ ensures that any work with the MPL continues to have the MPL rights in subsequent versions. MPL is used together with
 GNU GPL
