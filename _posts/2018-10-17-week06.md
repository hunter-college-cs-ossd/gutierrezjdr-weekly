## Assignment 8

  Assignment 8 really solidified git for me. This was definitely the practice I needed. I feel like I did a lot of errors in the previous git 
  assignment. For example, I completely forgot to set up my my user.name in git so my pull request came up as done by unknown. 
  This time I have fixed that problem ( hopefully, let me know if it was not).
  I also understand the flow much better. During the first assignment I felt like I was pretty much guessing when things were not working or when things go wrong.
  One example was how I would try to git remote add upstream outisde of the directory of the clone. I did not understand that when cloning, git creates a 
  directory for you and that the git file is inside. So instead I kept trying to add a directory simply because I did not understanding this logic. 
 
  I also had problems leaving the commit comment area. This was due to me not reading the instructions in the bottom asking to simply change the name or press enter. 
  This took me an hour to figure out in the previous assignment. After all the errors and painful confusion I was able to use what I learned and complete this Assignment within an hour. 
  It felt super satisfying to finally understand the workflow and being able to do all three helped with the repetition. I think this Assignment was very helpful.
