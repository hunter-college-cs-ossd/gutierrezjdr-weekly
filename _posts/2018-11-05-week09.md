 __High Level Project Evaluation Criteria__

* _Is it open source? This is obviously the first question to answer. A negative answer for this one stops
further evaluation._

     Yes this project is a [Free and Open Source Software](https://qgis.org/en/site/about/index.html). 
      
* _What is its license? Does the license allow for forks and modifications?_

    This project has a [Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) license.
    This licence allow us to share and develop the code for any reason even commercially. This is possible as long as you give credit
    when sharing and also as long as it is distributed under the same licence it originally came with. 
    
* _How active is this project? Are people actively submitting issues and are people closing issues in a
timely manner?_
   I looked at the [C++ Plugin](https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/plugindevelopment.html#qgis-cpp-plugin-development)   section of the website which leade me to their Github page. Their last accepted [pull request](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr) was 14 minutes ago (from the time I am writing this which is 11/01/2018 7:09PM)
   
* _How welcoming does the community seem? Are people friendly in the issue discussions, the discussion
forum, and chat?_

  Not many of the pull requests seemed too active but I chose one with 14 comments. It is pull requet [#8383](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8383). Everyone here is super friendly. There was healthy feedback about using `this` instead of calling the current object or in this case `currentThread`. Both parties took each others responses very well and explained their position politely. My favorite comment was _"Come for the fix, stay for the educational comments... ðŸ˜‰ this drove me insane, thanks for working out a fix."_ which tells me that the community is very open to teaching and learning together. 

* _How easy is it to find information about contributing to the project? Are there clear guides and
documentation that can help someone who wants to contribute? Are there written guides about rules
of conduct, for example? In short, is it an inviting project?_

   There is great [documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/developers_guide/codingstandards.html) on the website. It includes all the information from the tools being used as well as the common naming practices used in their development. The document is super organized and partitioned into understandable sections which makes it easy to find what you need. This is very welcoming for a newcomer starting from scratch. I could nto find  a code of conduct but maybe I just did not dig in the right area. Either way it wasn't easy to find if it does exist. 
   
* _What programming languages are used in the project?_
   
   THe program seems ot use only C++ or Python as these are the only two languages accepted for [plugins](https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/plugindevelopment.html#qgis-cpp-plugin-development). It also has some html and css as shown in [this](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/doc) folder in their github. There also T2T file types which are just old CAD files and not a language. 
   
* _What is the development environment, and how hard is it to download and install it?_

  This project uses QTCreator as their IDE. It is super easy to install especially because the instructions are straight to the point
  and there are [pictures](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/developers_guide/qtcreator.html#setting-up-your-build-environment) showing every single step.
  
* _How hard is it to understand the project code? Is it a large code base?_

   I was shocked by how easy the code is to read. Every single part of the code that can be seperated IS seperated making it easy to find the chunk of code you are  looking for. I specifically went to the _gui_  folder and into the [_editorwidget_](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/src/gui/editorwidgets) section. Naming conventions for the files are super consistent and even the code spacing is the same if not similar. It is satisfying to switch from files and see the same structure between them especially when each file has been fixed by multiple people. 
  
* _Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as database or graphics libraries?_

  One additional software this project uses is Doxygen according to their [API Documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/developers_guide/codingstandards.html#api-documentation) section. There is also an [_external_](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/external) folder where all their external libraries are kept. One example is the [_libDXFrw_](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/external/libdxfrw/libdxfrw.cpp) which reads and writes DXF files. They also use _astyle_, _kdbush_, _licensecheck_,_mdal_,_nmea_,_o2_,_opencl-clhpp_,_poly2tri_,_qspatialite_, _qt3dextra-headers_, _qwtpolar-1.1.1_, and _wintoast_.
  
* _How much does one need to know about the domain of the application in order to understand the
code? For example, if it is a health-related application, how much medical or biological background
would a contributor need?_
   Because QGIS is a geographic information system that uses 3D space, it uses rasters and vectors to determine location and even terrain. Although I have worked with vectors, I have never heard of a raster so I would have to do more research in that topic. I would also have to brush up on my knowledge of graph theory in order to maximize efficiency since the vector data is stored as a point, line, or polygon feature. 
   
   
* _How complicated is the code and how large is it?_

  The code is pretty large with what seems to have over 50+ individual files (probably more than 100). Despite this the code seems really easy to understand as they have dependency graphs for each file such as [this](https://qgis.org/api/qgsgeonodeconnection_8cpp.html) example from the API documentation. They even have brief [descriptions](https://qgis.org/api/annotated.html) on what each class does. Also because their coe is seperated so well it also makes it more legible and less overwhelming. 
  
* _How mature is the project? Is it very new, or has it been around for a long time? Does it have a stable
release yet?_
   It has been around for 16 years as its initial release was July 2002 according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QGIS). It's last stable release was on October 26th 2018 which was 3 days ago from this date (once again it is, 11/01/2018).

* _Is the project interesting and/or exciting to you?_

  This project is definitely interesting especially since I can do both C++ and Python. Understanding graph theory and its place in determining 3D spaces and directional decisions or location. 
 
__Finding the Project License__

* _What is the projectâ€™s license? There might be more than one. If so, what are some of the licenses that
you found? On most source forges there will be a file named LICENSE or something similar in the root
level of the repository._

__Assessing Activity__

 __High Level Project Evaluation Criteria__

* _Is it open source? This is obviously the first question to answer. A negative answer for this one stops
further evaluation._

    Yes it is [open source](https://sahanafoundation.org/eden/).
      
* _What is its license? Does the license allow for forks and modifications?_
  They work under the [MIT License](https://github.com/sahana/eden/blob/master/LICENSE).
  It does give permission to use modify copy and publisj as long as the copyright is included in all copies. 
  
* _How active is this project? Are people actively submitting issues and are people closing issues in a
timely manner?_
   The last open issue was from April and some of these are even from 2016. The last closed issue was May 30th. It is not in a timely manner so for this class it might not be the right project. 
  
* _How welcoming does the community seem? Are people friendly in the issue discussions, the discussion
forum, and chat?_
 It seems pretty welcoming especially in [this](https://github.com/sahana/eden/issues/1485) example where the maintainer gave some feedback and clear explanation of what the goals of the program are. 
 
* _How easy is it to find information about contributing to the project? Are there clear guides and
documentation that can help someone who wants to contribute? Are there written guides about rules
of conduct, for example? In short, is it an inviting project?_
  There is a [developer wiki](http://eden.sahanafoundation.org/). It contains very detailed goals for each location such as this [application](http://eden.sahanafoundation.org/wiki/BluePrint/Menu) section which goes over deficiencies, proposed solutions and even old ideas.
  
* _What programming languages are used in the project?_
  Not including user interface, it mostly runs on Python as shown in the [_models_](https://github.com/sahana/eden/tree/master/models) folder and the [_cron_](https://github.com/sahana/eden/tree/master/cron) folder. 
  It states here that they also use [javascript](http://eden.sahanafoundation.org/wiki/DeveloperGuidelines/Basics).
  
* _What is the development environment, and how hard is it to download and install it?_
      The [download page](http://eden.sahanafoundation.org/wiki/InstallationGuidelines) for the developer environment is clear. They use the VirtualBox ot run a Virtual Machine with a [page](http://eden.sahanafoundation.org/wiki/InstallationGuidelines/VirtualMachine) that has clear instructions. 
      
* _How hard is it to understand the project code? Is it a large code base?_
  The code seems extremely legible especially because its Python so spacing does matter. [This](https://github.com/sahana/eden/blob/master/models/00_utils.py) is a good example of this. 
  
  
* _Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as database or graphics libraries?_

   Yes they do. They even have a [_Libraries_](http://eden.sahanafoundation.org/wiki/DeveloperGuidelines/Libraries) page in the wiki with all this information. 
   
* _How much does one need to know about the domain of the application in order to understand the
code? For example, if it is a health-related application, how much medical or biological background
would a contributor need?_

* _How complicated is the code and how large is it?_
 Code does not seem too complicated. From what I saw, the Python section did not seem like too much but there was n extensive amount of javascript in [this](https://github.com/sahana/eden/tree/master/static/scripts) folder. It does not seem too hard from the code I have seen. 
 
* _How mature is the project? Is it very new, or has it been around for a long time? Does it have a stable
release yet?_
 The project is 8 years old. It was first deployed followin the 2010 [Haiti earthquake](https://sahanafoundation.org/eden/deployments/).

* _Is the project interesting and/or exciting to you?_
This project is definitely interesting but it does not seem to update regularly enough for me to want to join for this class. 

__Finding the Project License__

* _What is the projectâ€™s license? There might be more than one. If so, what are some of the licenses that
you found? On most source forges there will be a file named LICENSE or something similar in the root
level of the repository._
They work under the [MIT License](https://github.com/sahana/eden/blob/master/LICENSE).
  It does give permission to use modify copy and publisj as long as the copyright is included in all copies.

   Sanikiluaq,

 __High Level Project Evaluation Criteria__

* _Is it open source? This is obviously the first question to answer. A negative answer for this one stops
further evaluation._

     Yes this project is Open Source as it uses the GNU General Public License. 
      
* _What is its license? Does the license allow for forks and modifications?_
  It is the [GNU General Public License](https://www.openhub.net/licenses/GNU_General_Public_License_v2_0_only).
    
* _How active is this project? Are people actively submitting issues and are people closing issues in a
timely manner?_
  
   Issues are not actively being closed with about 10 days between each closed issue. 
   Also there are almost 2,000 opened issues. Holy cow. They definitely do not close them in a timely manner.
   But after a second look, the oldest issue was from July 1st so in relaity it is not "that bad" but seeing so many issues opened in such little time seems like a red flag to me. 
   
* _How welcoming does the community seem? Are people friendly in the issue discussions, the discussion
forum, and chat?_
 Most open issues do have comments but pull requests do not have much. Even closed pull requests have less comments than recently closed issues. Seems like they are active but not as much as when it comes to closing these down. 
 
* _How easy is it to find information about contributing to the project? Are there clear guides and
documentation that can help someone who wants to contribute? Are there written guides about rules
of conduct, for example? In short, is it an inviting project?_

The [documentation](http://doxygen.org/manual/autolink.html) seems extremely overwhelming especially from the perspective of a new potential contributor. It seems overwhelming because there is not consistent way in which the information is split up. It just seems like they added new tabs as they went along. 

* _What programming languages are used in the project?_
  According to [this](http://doxygen.org/manual/starting.html) page, the project supports C, C++, C#, Objective-C, IDL, Java, VHDL, PHP, Python, Tcl, Fortran, and D. 
  
* _What is the development environment, and how hard is it to download and install it?_

  I am not entirely sure but the [download page](http://www.doxygen.org/download.html) is the best I could get for this answer. 
  
* _How hard is it to understand the project code? Is it a large code base?_
 It is extremely hard. In [this](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/blob/master/src/entry.cpp) file there are barely any spaces between lines of code. 
 
* _Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as database or graphics libraries?_

  I am not sure but [this](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/tree/master/libmd5) folder seems to be a spot for some libraries. Again I am not entirely sure after looking for a while. I did not see it int he documentation either. 


* _How much does one need to know about the domain of the application in order to understand the
code? For example, if it is a health-related application, how much medical or biological background
would a contributor need?_
  I think someone would need to know a lot abut strings and parsing especially in C++. Although there are some add-ons that already exist it must be good to know in order to fix any issues inside them. 
  
* _How complicated is the code and how large is it?_

It is massive. Just looking at all the individual file in the [_src_](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/tree/master/src) folder gave me a headache. 

* _How mature is the project? Is it very new, or has it been around for a long time? Does it have a stable
release yet?_
   It's first commit was December 1999. I think this says enough on how old this is. 
   
* _Is the project interesting and/or exciting to you?_
  It was interesting at first but the lack of organization made me lose my interest. I will have nightmares about that source folder. 
  Can I get credit for simply organizing the source folder?

__Finding the Project License__

* _What is the projectâ€™s license? There might be more than one. If so, what are some of the licenses that
you found? On most source forges there will be a file named LICENSE or something similar in the root
level of the repository._

  It is the [GNU General Public License](https://www.openhub.net/licenses/GNU_General_Public_License_v2_0_only).
  
__Assessing Activity__
I use the [DOxygen Github](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen) for the following questions. 
* _When was the last commit?_
   It was November 1st, 2018.
   
* _How many contributors does the project have?_
   122
   
* _How often do people commit?_
    About a handful of times a day. 

* _How many open issues are there?_
  1,970
  
* _Do maintainers respond quickly to issues when they are opened?_
   Overall they tend to respond the day of the issue post. 
  
* _Is there active discussion on the issues?_
  There definitely are active discussions. Most issues ahve more than 1 comment on them. Or at least the recent ones do. Older ones are not as active. 
  
* _Are the issues recent?_
  Not all. Oldest are from July 1st.
  
* _Are issues getting closed?_
  I would say they are at a moderate pace. Last one was 3 days ago. 

* _How many open pull requests are there?_

  There are 72. 
  
* _Do maintainers respond quickly to pull requests when they are opened?_

 Not really. If they do at all, recently they have been close to the post date but older pull requests seem to have wider gaps between them such as [this](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/pull/577).
 
* _Is there active discussion on the pull requests?_
  No especially because they barely comment on them anyways. 
  
* _Are the pull requests recent?_
  Within 2 weeks yes. 
  
* _How recently were any pull requests merged?_
   Actually they merge pretty frequently. It seems to be about every 5 days or so. 
   
* _Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues? Are responses generally constructive?_
  User _albert-github_ tries their best to respond to most issues in a  polite way so I will answer yes for this question. 
  
* _Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat?_
  User _albert-github_ is friendly. Didn't see any judgements as I read through issues.
  
* _Do pull requests get reviewed?_
  I barely saw reviewers. I saw one at most but I lsot it while looking through other pull requests. It was a pull request reviewed by the DOxygen github account. 
  
* _Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?_
Again, sadly no. :(
