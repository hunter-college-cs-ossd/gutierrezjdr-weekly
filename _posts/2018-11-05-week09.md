 __High Level Project Evaluation Criteria__

* _Is it open source? This is obviously the first question to answer. A negative answer for this one stops
further evaluation._

     Yes this project is a [Free and Open Source Software](https://qgis.org/en/site/about/index.html). 
      
* _What is its license? Does the license allow for forks and modifications?_

    This project has a [Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) license.
    This licence allow us to share and develop the code for any reason even commercially. This is possible as long as you give credit
    when sharing and also as long as it is distributed under the same licence it originally came with. 
    
* _How active is this project? Are people actively submitting issues and are people closing issues in a
timely manner?_
   I looked at the [C++ Plugin](https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/plugindevelopment.html#qgis-cpp-plugin-development)   section of the website which leade me to their Github page. Their last accepted [pull request](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr) was 14 minutes ago (from the time I am writing this which is 11/01/2018 7:09PM)
   
* _How welcoming does the community seem? Are people friendly in the issue discussions, the discussion
forum, and chat?_

  Not many of the pull requests seemed too active but I chose one with 14 comments. It is pull requet [#8383](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8383). Everyone here is super friendly. There was healthy feedback about using `this` instead of calling the current object or in this case `currentThread`. Both parties took each others responses very well and explained their position politely. My favorite comment was _"Come for the fix, stay for the educational comments... ðŸ˜‰ this drove me insane, thanks for working out a fix."_ which tells me that the community is very open to teaching and learning together. 

* _How easy is it to find information about contributing to the project? Are there clear guides and
documentation that can help someone who wants to contribute? Are there written guides about rules
of conduct, for example? In short, is it an inviting project?_

   There is great [documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/developers_guide/codingstandards.html) on the website. It includes all the information from the tools being used as well as the common naming practices used in their development. The document is super organized and partitioned into understandable sections which makes it easy to find what you need. This is very welcoming for a newcomer starting from scratch. I could nto find  a code of conduct but maybe I just did not dig in the right area. Either way it wasn't easy to find if it does exist. 
   
* _What programming languages are used in the project?_
   
   THe program seems ot use only C++ or Python as these are the only two languages accepted for [plugins](https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/plugindevelopment.html#qgis-cpp-plugin-development). It also has some html and css as shown in [this](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/doc) folder in their github. There also T2T file types which are just old CAD files and not a language. 
   
* _What is the development environment, and how hard is it to download and install it?_

  This project uses QTCreator as their IDE. It is super easy to install especially because the instructions are straight to the point
  and there are [pictures](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/developers_guide/qtcreator.html#setting-up-your-build-environment) showing every single step.
  
* _How hard is it to understand the project code? Is it a large code base?_

   I was shocked by how easy the code is to read. Every single part of the code that can be seperated IS seperated making it easy to find the chunk of code you are  looking for. I specifically went to the _gui_  folder and into the [_editorwidget_](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/src/gui/editorwidgets) section. Naming conventions for the files are super consistent and even the code spacing is the same if not similar. It is satisfying to switch from files and see the same structure between them especially when each file has been fixed by multiple people. 
  
* _Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as database or graphics libraries?_

  One additional software this project uses is Doxygen according to their [API Documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/developers_guide/codingstandards.html#api-documentation) section. There is also an [_external_](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/external) folder where all their external libraries are kept. One example is the [_libDXFrw_](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/external/libdxfrw/libdxfrw.cpp) which reads and writes DXF files. They also use _astyle_, _kdbush_, _licensecheck_,_mdal_,_nmea_,_o2_,_opencl-clhpp_,_poly2tri_,_qspatialite_, _qt3dextra-headers_, _qwtpolar-1.1.1_, and _wintoast_.
  
* _How much does one need to know about the domain of the application in order to understand the
code? For example, if it is a health-related application, how much medical or biological background
would a contributor need?_
   Because QGIS is a geographic information system that uses 3D space, it uses rasters and vectors to determine location and even terrain. Although I have worked with vectors, I have never heard of a raster so I would have to do more research in that topic. I would also have to brush up on my knowledge of graph theory in order to maximize efficiency since the vector data is stored as a point, line, or polygon feature. 
   
   
* _How complicated is the code and how large is it?_

  The code is pretty large with what seems to have over 50+ individual files (probably more than 100). Despite this the code seems really easy to understand as they have dependency graphs for each file such as [this](https://qgis.org/api/qgsgeonodeconnection_8cpp.html) example from the API documentation. They even have brief [descriptions](https://qgis.org/api/annotated.html) on what each class does. Also because their coe is seperated so well it also makes it more legible and less overwhelming. 
  
* _How mature is the project? Is it very new, or has it been around for a long time? Does it have a stable
release yet?_
   It has been around for 16 years as its initial release was July 2002 according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QGIS). It's last stable release was on October 26th 2018 which was 3 days ago from this date (once again it is, 11/01/2018).

* _Is the project interesting and/or exciting to you?_

  This project is definitely interesting especially since I can do both C++ and Python. Understanding graph theory and its place in determining 3D spaces and directional decisions or location. 
 
__Finding the Project License__

* _What is the projectâ€™s license? There might be more than one. If so, what are some of the licenses that
you found? On most source forges there will be a file named LICENSE or something similar in the root
level of the repository._

   THere are 33 pull requests open. 

__Assessing the Welcomeness__

* _Do maintainers respond quickly to pull requests when they are opened?_
   Yes. It seems like most maintainers respond within the day.
   
* _Is there active discussion on the pull requests?_
   Almost all open pull requests have a comment in them and numerous have 10 or more comments. 
 
* _Are the pull requests recent?_
  Most are recent but the oldest pull requests were form Sptember 24th.

  [Yes.](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8377) 

* _Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat?_
  Yes. Here's an[example](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8385).
  
* _Do pull requests get reviewed?_
  Here is one example of a ["review"](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/8377#issuecomment-434454904) although its just a confimation from one person but besides this one example there are no reviewers assigned in the -Reviewer_ section.
