## Assignment 6 Part 1: 

 In this assignment, I worked together with Chocolate-Spaghet and johncgenere. In the first round of pull requests and proofreading, I am responsible this week for looking through Chocolate-Spaghet's work. What I thought was interesting was howmuch I learned from reading his work. Although we read the same article's it seems I may have missed certain things that he notices. For example, I knew that Richard Stallman helped  create open source licensing but I did not know it was called "copyleft". Also, Chocolate-Spaghet added an extra article which helped expand my knowledge on open source software. 
 
One difficulty I have when fixing other people's work is determining the difference between grammer/sentence errors and preferences. For example, there are some things that I think personally sound better in a certain order.  I am not always sure if this is a peronal preference or a grammer error. This is a problem because I worry that I will change someone else's work so much that it mgiht sound like mine instead of their work. I do not want to cover their voice with mine so I was very conservative with my changes. Despite all this I enjoy my group and we have no problems communicating properly with each other which is gratifying, especially from my previous experiences.
