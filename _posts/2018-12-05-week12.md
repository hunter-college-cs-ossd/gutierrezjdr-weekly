### Godot Progress Report
---

The second week of working on Godot consisted of trying to submit our pull request to Godot as a solution to 
our chosen issue which was issue [#2967](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/2967). Our pull request
[#24048](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/24048) was rejected. It was explained to us that we misunderstood the 
issue as we had worked on solving the issue for the tooltip but not for the button itself.  

A user by the name of _Naryosha_ responded that they had started to work on the issue but could not dedicate time to 
solve it. They put a picture up of their work so far. It looked pretty much done so we clarified with them 
if what all they were missing were margin fixes. They responded confirming this was the issue. Therefore I made a fork to
Naryosha's branch in order for us to work on it. We tried working on Naryosha's code but the margin issue proved to be to difficult 
to deal with inside her fork. We decided to look for am easier issue because of the lack of time.
