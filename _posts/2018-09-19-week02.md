## Assignment 3: 

   This is an interesting situation where one mistake was used to discredit a valid argument. Although BrillLyle did break the rules it seems like the editors used this as a reason to invalidate her previous statement and concerns. If the concern itself was dealt with properly then I would say that their actions against her were reasonable but because there was, in my opinion, a biased view of this situation, I do not believe she was reprimanded fairly. 
   
   My opinion stems from a few points in the comment for deletion. First of all, BrillLyle cited many articles that proved Catalina's notability. She listed sources form El Diario, El Espectador and [NY1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NY1) which are all notable primary sources. They all have Wikipedia pages themselves desribing their long histories. [El Diario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Diario_La_Prensa) has been printing news since 1913. The article was even published in [January 2018](https://eldiariony.com/2018/01/28/catalina-cruz-uno-nunca-sabe-las-vueltas-que-da-la-vida/) ( months before the deletion of the wikipedia article). They [use BBC as an example of a reputable source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources) but it was founded about a decade after El Diario. So it brings up the question, how long does a Spanish newspaper need to become a reputable source for these editors?
 Another point is that a Wikimedia group from Columbia chimed in with their support for BrillLyle on her article. The "User Group Wikimedians of Colombia" whose goal is to ["encourage among the Colombian population the use of initiatives and projects that in one form or another permit free use and distribution of knowledge, both for consultation and for publishing content."](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Affiliations_Committee/Resolutions/Wikimedistas_de_Colombia_User_Group_-_June_2014)
 
 In order for a group to be a recognized Wikimedia User Group they must have a minimum of three active editors each with [more than 300 edits or contributions.](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_user_groups/Requirements) Despite this fact, user Bearcat reffuses to hear these editors out because " it is not our role to help them rectify that by creating special carve-outs from our inclusion standards just because of a person's gender or sexuality or ethnic background". The User Group Wikimedians of Colombia deserves as much input as Bearcat yet their opinion is not taken as serious. Bearcat uses a defense that is usually used by the right especially when it comes to Affirmative Action and Welfare where they believe that they are not responsible for reperations for the actions fo their ancestors thereby ignoring history and white privilege completely. Now I am not saying Bearcat is racist but he definitely has an implicit bias that is damaging and makes me wary of Wikipedia especially when [only 17% of their staff are women.](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/15/wikipedia-edit-a-thon-women-arts) 
 
A few more points, Bearcat uses [WP:GNG.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability#General_notability_guideline), specifically about Catalina not receiveing enough "significant coverage". Not only is this an arbitray value that is based on opinion with no detailed rubric to determine adequacy, but it also states in this article "Significant coverage is more than a trivial mention, **but it does not need to be the main topic of the source material".** He also uses [WP:NPOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(people)#Politicians_and_judges) as a way to prove that since she has not been elected yet she cannot have a page. Yet in the article it states that **"Politicians and judges who have held international, national or sub-national (statewide/provincewide) office, and members or former members of a national, state or provincial legislature."** which Catalina has done before as an [Assistant Attorney General to Cuomo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Assistant_Attorney_General). This is, by the way, an official post elected or not. 

Politicians in general do not get a lot of attention in media unless there are scandals or corruption involved. This policy, although it probably had good intentions, hurts those that try to have a clean slate with no scandals or crimes in order to win their first race. If Wikipedia had a more diverse team maybe the echo chamber would change into open intersectional conversations.

**For further reading I recommend a reading these Wikipedia pages on [Gender Bias in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_bias_on_Wikipedia) and [Racial Bias In Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_bias_on_Wikipedia) but make sure to read other sources as these may be biased.**
